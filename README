Content of the rpg's project:

Creation of an engine that allow:
    -Create, load and unload scene.
    -Create gameObject, a gameObject can be:
        -Button
        -Block
        -Text
        -Player
        -Mob
        -Image
    -Create node.

    All of these gamObject is modular and we can create the gameObject we want with
custom properties.

    For the button we can change the scale, sprite, three sprites for each state,
the action, the text inside the button, the position, a help box, the layer. That's
the same function, but according to the type of the gameObject for the all other
gameObject.

    For the node we can change his position, rotation, scale. we can assign several
gameObject.

Our engine has multi-thread to load the game.

We have a little physique engine, for the player and dropping bloc.

There is water physique, basic but it's look like water.

A full option volume, and we can change the control.

An advanced collision system with shape.
